Ember Map Demo
==============

https://github.com/samwich/ember-map-demo.git

A Google Map with a list of locations linked together with Ember.js and Mustache.

  * Click the map to add locations.
  * Select a location in the list or click a marker and its details will be shown.
  * Supports deleting locations.
  * Locations are not persisted to a web service.
  * Code is rather ugly :-) Send me a pull request!
